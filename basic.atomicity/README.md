## Atomicity

This project consists in several examples of how race conditions affect the execution of not properly synchronized programs. Main classes are:

* Interleaving: Shows how several steps are overlapped by different thread executions.
* Unsafe*: Non synchronized programs that show the effects of a race condition.
* Safe*: Properly synchronized programs where its execution is not affected by race conditions.

Please take a look at the article about [Atomicity and race conditions]
